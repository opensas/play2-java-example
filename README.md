Play framework 2 java application on OpenShift Express
============================

This git repository helps you get up and running quickly with a Play framework application
on OpenShift Express.


Running on OpenShift
----------------------------

Register at http://openshift.redhat.com/, and then create a raw (do-it-yourself) application:

    rhc app create -a play -t raw-0.1

Add this upstream play-example repo:

    cd play
    git remote add upstream -m master https://github.com/opensas/play2-java-example.git
    git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
    
Then push the repo upstream:

    git push

That's it, you can now see your application running at:

    http://play-yournamespace.rhcloud.com

If you are a perfectionist, now it would be a good time to change your application.name setting in conf/application.conf to match your application.

Working with a mysql database
----------------------------

Just issue:

    rhc app cartridge add -a play -c mysql-5.1

Don't forget to write down the credentials.

Then uncomment the following lines from your conf/application.conf, like this:

    # openshift mysql database
    %openshift.db.url=jdbc:mysql://${OPENSHIFT_DB_HOST}:${OPENSHIFT_DB_PORT}/${OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME}
    %openshift.db.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
    %openshift.db.user=admin
    %openshift.db.pass=<write your password here>

You can manage your new MySQL database by embedding phpmyadmin-3.4.

    rhc app cartridge add -a play -c phpmyadmin-3.4

It's also a good idea to create a different user with limited privileges on the database.

Updating your application
----------------------------

To deploy your changes to openshift just add your changes to the index, commit and push:

    git add . -A
    git commit -m "a nice message"
    git push origin

Working with modules
----------------------------

You don't have to do anything special, just add your modules to conf/dependencies.yml. Openshift will run

    play deps --forProd --clearcache

before starting you application, to make sure that your dependencias are all upto date.

Trouble shooting
----------------------------

To find out what's going on in openshift, issue

    rhc app tail -a play

If you feel like investigating further, you can

    rhc app show -a play

    Application Info
    ================
    play
        Framework: raw-0.1
        Creation: 2012-03-18T12:39:18-04:00
        UUID: youruuid
        Git URL: ssh://youruuid@play-yournamespace.rhcloud.com/~/git/raw.git/
        Public URL: http://play-yournamespace.rhcloud.com

Then you can connect using ssh like this:

    ssh youruuid@play-yournamespace.rhcloud.com

Having a look under the hood
----------------------------

**.openshift/action_hooks/pre_build** does the following everytime you push changes

* reads play version from _openshift.play.version_ at application.conf (1.2.4 by default)

* checks if the desired version is installed, if not it downloads and installs play framework at $OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR

* removes any other play framework version

then **.openshift/action_hooks/start** goes like this

* it executes **.openshift/action_hooks/stop** to stop the application

* cleans environment and update dependencies using _openshift.deps.params_ for play deps parameters (uses "--forProd --clearcache" by default)

```bash
    play clean
    play deps $DEPS_PARAMS -Divy.hom=/tmp/ivy2
```

* finally it starts the application, using _openshift.id_ (by default the configuration id to use is openshift). You can specify additional parameters with openshift.play.params.

```bash
    play start --%ID $PLAY_PARAMS
```

By default play will run in production mode, you can change it setting _%openshift.application.mode=dev_ in application.conf. The server will listen to ${OPENSHIFT_INTERNAL_PORT} at ${OPENSHIFT_INTERNAL_IP}.

* **.openshift/action_hooks/stop** just tries to kill the server.pid process, and then checks that no "java" process is running. If it's there, it tries five times to kill it nicely, and then if tries another five times to kill it with -SIGKILL.

Acknowledgments
----------------------------

I couldn't have developed this quickstart without the help of [marekjelen](https://github.com/marekjelen) who answered [my questions on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9446275/best-approach-to-integrate-netty-with-openshift) and who also shared his [JRuby quickstart repo](https://github.com/marekjelen/openshift-jruby#readme). (I know, open source rocks!)

It was also of great help Grant Shipley's [article on building a quickstart for openshift](https://www.redhat.com/openshift/community/blogs/how-to-create-an-openshift-github-quick-start-project).

Play framework native support for openshift was a long awaited and pretty popular feature (you are still on time to vote for it [here](https://www.redhat.com/openshift/community/content/native-support-for-play-framework-application)). So it's a great thing that Red Hat engineers came out with this simple and powerful solution, that basically let's you implement any server able to run on a linux box. Kudos to them!!!
